Stoxs
=====

Stoxs is a Symfony2 project and was built during [24 hour business camp](http://www.24hbc.se) 31/10-1/11 2011 under 24 hours by Magnus Nordlander ([@drrotmos](http://www.twitter.com/drrotmos)) and Jon Gotlin ([@jongotlin](http://www.twitter.com/jongotlin)).

The application is a platform for bidding for stock tips. The tips are sent via sms with a configurable amount of delay between the smses.

[Stoxs.se](http://www.stoxs.se) is the web site but as many other web projects this is not finished. We lack good connections with the stock market and haven't found a business partner and therefor we open sourced this project. We hope this can inpsire others to do something with the code!
